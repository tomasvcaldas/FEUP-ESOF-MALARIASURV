The **QIS Malaria Case Surveillance** application is an open-source mobile application designed to report positive cases of malaria detected throughout Cambodia in near real-time.

This application is intended to be used by healthcare providers in the field after they have conducted an mRDT (Malaria rapid diagnostic tests).

The application is based on the [QoCapplication](https://github.com/EyeSeeTea/malariapp) which allows to issue automatic generated surveys and retrieve and push information to a wide range of platform such as DHIS2 servers.
